# Pre-requisites for the “hands-on session”


To make the most of our time during the “hands-on session,” we require that the attendants have a GitHub account, a git client installed on their personal computer, and that they are familiar with the basic git commands (`git clone`, `git add`. `git pull` ). 

The following sections contains the instructions 
to open a GitHub account, install Git, and additional resources to refresh the git basics.

## 1. Open a GitHub account

If you don’t have a GitHub account, go to https://github.com/signup and follow the steps to open an account.
