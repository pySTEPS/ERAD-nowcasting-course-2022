# ERAD22 Academy: "Precipitation Nowcasting in the Wild"

The main goal of this course is to focus on practical aspects of nowcasting, for both users (how to make better nowcasts) and developers (how to contribute to an open-source project). 
The course will combine theory with hands-on sessions based on the open-source library pysteps, while offering an opportunity to gather the nowcasting community around pysteps to discuss challenges and future developments.

**When:** August 28, 2022

**Where:** Palacinema Locarno, Switzerland (or online)

**Registration:** [ERAD22 Academy](https://www.erad2022.ch/erad2022-academy)
