# Exercise 5: Blending and cell tracking
The purpose of this exercise is to illustrate other forecasting methods that have recently become part of pysteps. You can either work on part A: blending nowcasting with NWP or part B: cell tracking-based nowcasts. If time allows, you can try to do both.

## Part A: Blending with NWP
In this example, we are going to blend a nowcast with an NWP rainfall forecast using three different blending methods, which are implemented in pysteps. Examples of the blending methods are described in [Linear Blending](https://pysteps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_examples/plot_linear_blending.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-plot-linear-blending-py) and [STEPS blending](https://pysteps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_examples/blended_forecast.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-blended-forecast-py). We will loosely follow these examples, but for a different dataset from RMI Belgium, which asks for a few more pre-processing steps.

### Install pysteps
If you still have your notebook open, you have already installed pysteps and everything should work. If not, let's first run the first notebook (block 1) to install pysteps and configure it. This is needed because Colab notebooks are independent of each other and it's not possible to save the state of a notebook and use it in another one.

## Part B: Cell tracking
